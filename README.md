# Western_Boundary_Current_MHWs

A recent analysis by Oliver et al. (2018) showed that “Hotspots of high intensity occurred in regions of large SST variability including the five western boundary current [WBC] extension regions (+2–5 °C)…”. However, the analysis outlined below shows that it is not the WBCs that manifest the extreme thermal events, but rather that climatologically colder regions that flank the mean current trajectory (as per Aviso+ ocean surface velocities) experience the thermal pulses when they receive meanders and rings that deviate from the ‘mean current’ path.
