# The purpose of this script is to first create the AVISO and MHW databases
# used throughout this analysis because this script is to be run on the
# tikoraluk server and the database files are too large to send via
# conventional digital means
# These files are created here by:
  # 1) Loading the bounding box definitions
  # 2) Subsetting from the MHW and AVISO databases on tikoraluk
    # 2.1) The grids for these data already match on tikoraluk
      # so no converting is required

# With these databases recreated here, the next step is to re-calculate KE

# Then the eddy trajectory product from AVISO is used to create an eddy mask
#
# AJS: How? Why?

# With all of the results ready, the next step is to use the 90th perc.
# MKE mask and the 50th perc. MKE mask to define the region within which
# we want to compare MKE and MHW intensity
#
# AJS: Why a 50the perc MKE mask?

# We then mask these results with the eddy trajectory mask

# With the data masked in two progressive steps the co-occurences and correlations may then be run

# NB: This script is intended to be run via an R terminal
  # Therefore each different section should be (un)commented when desired

# Eddy masks --------------------------------------------------------------

# In this step we run a function that looks at the AVISO eddy track database
# and finds which pixels in each bbox are within the radius and centre point

# eddy_masks()


# Mask regions ------------------------------------------------------------

# In this step we take only the MKE and MHW pixels that are in the
# 50th percentile mask but not in the 90th percentile mask.
# We also take the pixels that are in the 90th percentile max intensity mask.
# In the process of screening out these pixels we also combine all KE, eddy, and MHW data
# Set cores

# Correlate pixels --------------------------------------------------------

# Here we take the days the pixels in the 50th perc. MKE and 90th perc. max int.
# areas are themselves in the 90th percentile for MKE.
# A count of how often this occurs when MHWs are occurring is made to find
# what the proportion of this occurence is.
# The MKE and mean intensities on days when MKE is in the 90th perc.
# are then correlated.
# This result helps to illustrate the potential relationship between
# meanders and MHWs.

# Visualise results -------------------------------------------------------

# Here is the naming convention for the figures produced below:

# region_finalStatistic_pixelFilter.pdf

### region: the acronym for the study region of interest
## finalStatistic: The result being shown. This is currently two things:
# cooc: This stands for co-occurrence and the figures show the rate of co-occurence
  # of the proportion of days when MWHs are occurring in a pixel against the total
  # number of days in that pixel (0 = none, 1 = perfect)
# prop: This stands for co-occurrence and the figures show the rate of co-occurence
  # of the proportion of days when MWHs are occurring in a pixel against the total
  # number of days in that pixel (0 = none, 1 = perfect)

## pixelFilter: This will say either "50" or "max"
# 50: Only pixels that are within the 50th to 90th percentile for
  # mean MKE in the region are being shown
# max: Only pixels that have had events whose max intensity is in
  # the 90th percentile for the study region are being shown

## Because there was no apparent monthly pattern I didn't save all of the monthly
# faceted figures as I didn't want to create too much clutter
# The code to create the monthly figures exists in "meander_vis()" in "setup/meanderFunctions.R"
# and must just be uncommented, and perhaps touched up a bit, in order to run

### Within each figure are many panels, the following is an explanation of them:
## Co-occurrence figures
# cooc_90: The proportion of days when the pixel had a value at or above the 90th perc.
  # MKE for the study area while a MHW was also occurring
  # These rates tend to be much higher, some are aproaching 1.0 (i.e. 100% MHW co-occurrence)
# cooc_anticyclone: When the pixel had an anticyclone and a MHW at the same time
# cooc_base: All days of observation and the rate at which MHWs were also occurring
  # This is the base-line for MHW occurrence and is usually around 10% as expected
# cooc_cyclone: When the pixel had a cyclone and a MHW at the same time
# cooc_eddy: All days when eddies of any sort were present along with a MHW
  # This is generally less than either of the anti/cyclone values
  # Meaning that depending on the hemisphere the type of eddy matters for heat transport
  # i.e. cold or warm cores
# cooc_no_eddy: Days when no eddies are present and also a MHW is occurring
  # This tends to be similar to cooc_base
# cooc_no_eddy_90: When a pixels MKE is in the 90th perc. when there is a MHW but no eddy present
  # This is the target result and the main hypothesis test
  # Doesn't look much different than cooc_90
## Proportion figures
# prop_90: The proportion of days in the pixel that are at or above
  # the 90th perc. MKE for the study area
# prop_90_MHW: The proportion of MHW days that occurred when the KE on the given day was
  # at or above the 90th perc. MKE for the study area
# prop_anticyclone: The proportion of total days when an anticyclone was present
# prop_anticyclone_MHW: The proportion of total MHW days when an anticyclone was present
# prop_cyclone: The proportion of total days when a cyclone was present
# prop_cyclone_anticyclone: The proportion of cyclone days vs. anticyclone days
  # NB: There is a lot of grey area in these panels because I have limited the scale
  # of the colour bar to 0 - 1
  # Most of the grey area is caused by much higher proportions of cyclones to anticyclones
# prop_cyclone_MHW: The proportion of total MHW days when a cyclone was present
# prop_eddy: The proportion of total days when an eddy on any sort was present
# prop_eddy_MHW: The proportion of total MHW days when an eddy of any sort was present
# prop_no_eddy: The proportion of total days when no eddies were present
# prop_no_eddy_90: The proportion of total days when no eddies were present and
  # the KE was at or above the 90th perc. MKE for the study area
# prop_no_eddy_90_MHW: The proportion of total MHW days when no eddies were present and
  # the KE was at or above the 90th perc. MKE for the study area
# prop_no_eddy_MHW: The proportion of total MHW days when ano eddies were present
